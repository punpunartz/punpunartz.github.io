        <div class="about-me">
            <p>My name is Nichole Ramos and i'm a graphic designer, illustrator and animator that <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>loves to express herself through her creations</b></span>. I've always loved to draw like at school, at home, or simply anywhere. I choose to be a graphic designer as it has opened a new gate for me, filling my life with amazing oportunities. I am currently a senior student at University of Puerto Rico from Humacao, my BA concentrated in <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>Comunications with emphasis in Graphic Design</b></span>. </p>
            
            <p>I am currently in charge of an important position in our department's Comunication Association, AECOM (Asociación de Estudiantes de Comunicación), in charge of Public Relations which makes me able to prepare myself for the future by <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>illustrating and managing social media</b></span>. I will add that I've worked under the supervision of one of the best professors in the department, Marcia Pacheco, and I was able to create a <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>welcoming animation</b></span> for the new members of AECOM. Such projects fill me with enthusiasm, skills, and strength when it comes to design and animation.</p> 
            
            <p>I aspire so many things, but one of them is to put my animations out to the world and be recognized by my talent. Having my original character <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>PunPun</b></span> come to life through my drawings and animation is <span style="color: #db69a1"><b>my main goal</b></span>. She thrives me to continue, to create comics, to enhance her story, and to make others laugh; someday she will be so big that my dream of being recognized will become a reality.</p>
